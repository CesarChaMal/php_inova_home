		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">Date fields on web input forms have long been a 
				stumbling block for users and developers alike.&nbsp; Users, who as we know 
				come in all different shapes and sizes, are used to their own particular date 
				formatting.&nbsp; When entering data on the web, most find themselves having to 
				choose between a dash or a slash,&nbsp;european or american formatting, 
				etc.,&nbsp;many times with frustrating results.&nbsp; If you are developer 
				giving a demonstration of your web application, or a merchant trying to make a 
				sale, frustrating the user can cost you well-deserved sales.&nbsp; </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">On the flip-side, developers then must solve their own 
				problems with date input fields.&nbsp; Usually you have to put these results 
				into a database.&nbsp; This means it has to be in a specific format.&nbsp; What 
				if it's an invalid date?&nbsp; Even with your own validation routines, there is 
				too much potential to raise an error.&nbsp; Most software developers have long 
				ago learned to add a pop-up calendar into their form to facilitate date 
				picking, but until now there has been no comparable input control for web 
				pages.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">DateClick is a "drop-in" web component written 
				entirely in client-side Javascript.&nbsp; With no unnecessary server-side code, 
				the DateClick pop-up calendar can be called from any type of web page--HTML, 
				ASP, ASP.NET,&nbsp;PHP, JSP, etc..&nbsp; Any page that will be viewed in a 
				browser will load DateClick.&nbsp; </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">The DateClick icon will normally reside next to one 
				or more date entry fields on your web entry form.&nbsp; The calendar can 
				be configured to appear either when the icon detects a click event or 
				a mouse-over&nbsp;(Pro version).&nbsp; Without any round-trips back to the server, the calendar appears 
				using cross-browser compatible DHTML.&nbsp; The appearance of the calendar is 
				highly configurable with CSS and design-time options that are passed to the 
				calendar upon creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration options such as non-English 
				display, begin on Monday, international date formatting, custom delimiters, and 
				many more are available.&nbsp; </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">DateClick has been designed to allow the selection of 
				any date with as few clicks as possible, and was designed from the ground up 
				with the most versatile navigation of any comparable product.&nbsp; <I>A date as 
				far away as 30 or 40 years can be chosen with a fraction of the amount of 
				clicking</I> on traditional GUI calendars&nbsp;thanks to the year fly-out.&nbsp; 
				Any month of the year is one click away on the month fly-out in addition to the 
				more traditional "next month", "previous month" navigaton.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">Once a date has been selected, it is passed back to 
				the input field of your choice in the format you specify.&nbsp; Thus a normally 
				frustrating and time consuming operation can be completed in as little as a 
				single click!&nbsp; </FONT>

		<P><a name="difference"><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>What's the difference between Standard (free) and Pro/Developer?</STRONG></FONT></a></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">DateClick is geared towards developers of complicated user
			interfaces and web pages, but we believe the casual user should be able to have
			powerful user interface design as well.  DateClick Standard is <i>free</i> for
			non-commercial use.  This includes blogs, non-profits, sites run as a hobby,
			open source, etc..  For the professional user, DateClick Pro and Developer
			include <i>many</i> powerful enhancements (see the list of options below) and
			can be licensed for use on pages that generate sales and ad revenue.  The
			Developer version can even be included in your own distributable web applications
			royalty free!  See <a href="http://www.primorissoftware.com/purchase.asp">the Primoris Software website</a>
			for more details on the commercial versions.

		<P><a name="adding"><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>Adding DateClick to Your Web 
Page</STRONG></FONT></a></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">DateClick is an object-oriented JavaScript component designed to 
be added to your page&nbsp;with minimal effort.&nbsp; Adding one or more 
pop-up calendars to your page is as easy as creating the DateClick object and calling 
the method to write that object into the browser's window.&nbsp; Even if you 
are not familiar with Javascript syntax, you can copy and paste the examples into 
your own design with no special programming experience!&nbsp; A 
				summary of adding the code to your page follows:</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1">1. Add a 
reference to the script file that contains the object definition in the 
&lt;head&gt; tags of your web page.&nbsp; "<STRONG>&lt;script 
language='javascript' src=          
				           
				 'choosedate.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</STRONG>".  Also add a CSS
				 link to the style page to define the look of the calendar.
				 <strong>&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="calendar.css"&gt;</strong><BR>
				2. Create a variable and set it to a new instance of the object. 
				Notice&nbsp;the string in quotation marks that is passed to the method.&nbsp; 
				This is called the <STRONG>configuration string, </STRONG>and is how many internal 
				settings of the calendar are set.&nbsp; In this case, the FIELD parameter is 
				specified.&nbsp; Although this is not required to add the calendar to the page, 
				it <EM>is </EM>required if you want to pass the chosen date value into a form field.&nbsp; The field name 
				should be the full document path to the field, including the form name.<BR><STRONG>var&nbsp;cal1 = new 
calendar("FIELD:document.frm.datBegin;");</STRONG>&nbsp; This assumes that you 
have a form on your page named "frm" and an input field named datBegin.&nbsp; If 
this is not the case, add the code to include this on your page, or change the 
name of the form to match your 
				existing  set up.<BR>
				3. Call the writeCalendar() method of the calendar instance you created in the 
				location you want the icon to appear (this is using the default "document flow" 
				positioning--"absolute" positioning is also available).&nbsp;
				<BR><STRONG>cal1.writeCalendar();</STRONG>
				<BR>
				4. The supporting&nbsp;.CSS file (usually calendar.css) and .JS file 
				(choosedate.js) should be in the same directory as the page that DateClick has 
				been added to.&nbsp; The graphic files should by default be in a subdirectory 
				called "basic".&nbsp; </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>Pro: </STRONG>In the professional version, you 
				can specify the image directory and class name prefix.&nbsp; With this feature, 
				you can radically change the look of the DateClick popup calendar.&nbsp; By 
				default, this will be "basic", but by sending a "DIR" parameter in the 
				configuration string you can set this on a per-object basis.&nbsp; This is 
				especially useful if you need to have more than one style of calendar on one 
				page.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><a name="languages"><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>Different Languages and Date 
Formats</STRONG></FONT></a></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"> DateClick can be set to return 
				dates in 3 different formats.&nbsp; The default format is m/d/yyyy.&nbsp; By 
				setting the FORMAT property in the configuration string to 1 this will be in 
				d/m/yyyy format, and by setting it to 2 DateClick will return values in 
				yyyy/m/d format. </FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT size="1"><FONT face="Verdana">Although DateClick was programmed in America in English, the 
calendar can be displayed in almost any format in 
					almost any language.&nbsp; You can change the format to the 3 formats listed above,&nbsp;and you 
					can also specify whether leading 0's should be added and what delimiter should 
					be used between the month, day, and year.&nbsp; This will yield almost any 
					conceivable date format, such as yyyy-mm-dd, mm.dd.yyyy, dd-mm-yyyy, 
					etc..&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

		<P><a name="configuring"><FONT size="1"><FONT face="Verdana"><STRONG>Configuring 
Day and Month Displays</STRONG></FONT></FONT></a></P>
		<P><FONT size="1"><FONT face="Verdana"> The way DateClick displays the names 
					of the months and days is also configurable.&nbsp; Instead of display the default 
					of S, M, T,&nbsp;etc. for the days, you can configure it to show Sun, Mon, 
					Tue, ..., or Sonntag, Montag, Dienstag,... This is accomplished by overriding 
					the default ary_days property.&nbsp; Do this in Javascript directly after 
					creating the calendar object.&nbsp; An example would be: </FONT></FONT>
					<blockquote>
				<pre>&lt;script language=javascript&gt; <BR>	var myCal = new calendar("FIELD:document.formName.BeginDate;"); <BR>	myCal.aryDays = Array("Sonntag", "Montag", "Dienstag", "Mittwoch", "Donnerstag", "Freitag", "Samstag"); <BR> myCal.aryMonths = Array("Janvier", "Février",
		"Mars", "Avril", "Peut", "Juin", "Juillet", "Août", "Septembre", "Octobre", "Novembre",
		"Décembre");
myCal.writeCalendar();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
			</blockquote>
		<P>
			<FONT size="1"><FONT face="Verdana">The above example will create a calendar that will 
					display German dates in the&nbsp;day header&nbsp;row and French months. Notice 
					that when the myCal variable is declared, a string is passed that gives the 
					FIELD name.&nbsp; This is the only required configuration parameter.&nbsp; It 
					tells DateClick what input field to pass the date back to. </FONT></FONT>
		</P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><a name="starting"><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>Starting Day of the 
Week</STRONG></FONT></a></P>
		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="1"><STRONG>Pro: </STRONG>The DateClick calendar defaults 
				to a week beginning with Sunday, however the Professional version and above can 
				be configured to begin the week display on monday by passing a BEGINONMONDAY 
				value of 1 in the configuration string.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1><a name="string"><STRONG>The Configuration 
String</STRONG></a></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>When the DateClick calendar is created, a string is 
passed in the constructor to configure various options.&nbsp; The FIELD option 
is required--this tells DateClick which form field it should pass the selected 
date value to.&nbsp; See the configuration string passed in the following 
example:<BR></FONT></P>
					<blockquote>
				<pre>&lt;form name="formName"&gt;<BR>	&lt;input type="text" name="DateOfBirth"&gt;<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>	&lt;script language= javascript&gt; <BR>		var myCal = new calendar("FIELD:document.formName.DateOfBirth;");
		myCal.writeCalendar();
	&lt;/script&gt;<BR>&lt;/form&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>In this example, a DateClick object is 
created called myCal.&nbsp; It is created by instantiating a calendar object (This 
is the name of the DateClick calendar).&nbsp; In the parenthesis after calendar, 
a string is passed--that is a "string" of characters enclosed in 
quotation marks.&nbsp; The options in a configuration string are passed in exactly 
the same way as CSS options.&nbsp; There is a&nbsp;variable name followed by 
a colon, then the value of the field and a semi-colon.&nbsp; In this case, 
the variable is "FIELD", and the value is "document.formName.DateOfBirth".&nbsp; 
document is the Javascript reference to the web page you are adding DateClick 
to--this will always be just document.&nbsp;&nbsp;formName is the name of the form that encloses 
the DateOfBirth field, which is a text type of an HTML input.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=1><STRONG>Pro: </STRONG>The Professional and

how and when the DHTML pop-up calendar is displayed.&nbsp; A full reference can

		<i>New in version 1.3!</i><br>
		The MASK variable gives the ultimate flexibility in populating the selected
		date back to your input field.  Using a string that you construct you can
		dictate the exact format that will be passed to your form field.  For example,
		passing the string MASK:DDDD, MMMM d, YYYY would yield Friday, May 26, 2005.
		The available options are as follows:
		<table border="0">
			<tr>
				<td>D</td>
				<td>1-2 Digit Date</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>d</td>
				<td>Date with suffix</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>DD</td>
				<td>2 Digit Date</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>DDD</td>
				<td>First three letters of day</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>DDDD</td>
				<td>Full day name</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>M</td>
				<td>1-2 Digit Month</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>MM</td>
				<td>Two Digit Month</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>MMM</td>
				<td>First three letters of Month</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>MMMM</td>
				<td>Full month name</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>YY</td>
				<td>Two digit year</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>YYYY</td>
				<td>Four Digit Year</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br><br>
		Note that the full and partial month and day names are based on
		the FullDayNames and FullMonthNames array--which is completely
		configurable!  Not all date formats can be correctly
        read back into DateClick when setting the default date.  This 
        mostly includes dates that have month or day name literals in them,
        such as August instead of 08.
		
		Also note that this feature <b>overrides</b> the FORMAT, ZEROS,
		and DELIMITER options on the Pro and Developer versions.

    <TD vAlign=top>DIR</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70>basic</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>Probably the most powerful setting in 
      DateClick's configuration.&nbsp; By specifying a DIR parameter, you set a 
      specific class prefix and image directory upon which to base the 
      appearance of DateClick's icon and calendar pop-up.&nbsp; The main purpose 
      of this is to allow you to customize DateClick's appearance and to allow 
      multiple DateClick calendars on each screen all with a different look. By 
      setting this to a setting other than basic, you can create a whole new CSS 
      class structure prefixed by the chosen word that completely alters the 
      appearance.&nbsp; Also create a subdirectory with the name of your setting 
      and place the calendar icon and supplemental images within 
  it.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>STATIC</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70>0</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
		Set this to 1 to set the popup calendar to "static" mode--that is 
		DateClick always shows on the page without having to click a calendar
		icon to bring it up.
		<P><EM>e.g. STATIC:1;</EM></P>
  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>FUNCTION</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70></TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
		Pass the name of a function with this parameter that will be called
		when a date is selected.  Don't include the ()'s in this declaration.
		You must then define the function with one argument--this argument
		will be a Date object set to the selected date.  If a FIELD is passed
		as well as function, both the field will be set and the function will
		be called.
		<P><EM>e.g. FUNCTION:showDate;</EM></P>
  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>POSITION</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70>0</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
		Determines how the popup calendar will be positioned when it appears
        in non-static mode.
        <UL>
			<LI>0 - Default, calendar appears at the point of the mouse click.
            <LI>1 - Calendar appears at the location of the calendar icon.
            <LI>2 - Manual position.  Starts at the top left and can be offset
            	by X and Y parameters.
        </UL>
		<P><EM>e.g. POSITION:2;</EM></P>
  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>X and Y</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70>0</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
		Specifying X and Y in the configuration string will offset the popup calendar's
        screen position horizontally, with the X parameter, and vertically with the Y
        parameter.  For example, if your POSITION parameter is set to 1, and the X is
        set to 10 and the Y is set to 15, the string would look like POSITION:1;X:10;Y:15;
        and the result would be that when the calendar pops up, its location will be
        10 pixels to the right and 15 pixels down from the location of the icon image.
        The position can also be moved up or to the left by specifying negative values.
		<P><EM>e.g. X:200;</EM></P>
  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>TOOLTIP</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=70></TD>
    <TD vAlign=top>
		Pass text to the tooltip parameter to replace the default "Click here..."
		message that shows when the mouse hovers over the DateClick calendar icon.
		<P><EM>e.g. TOOLTIP:Click here to display a popup calendar;</EM></P>
